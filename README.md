# GalateaClone-site

I really liked this design of a modern and beautiful website, so I decided to recreate it. It was interesting to work on this website using grid and flex container, and I also learned some new animations.
Using JavaScript, I added functionality to add items to a cart and the ability to update quantities and complete a "purchase".
